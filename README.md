**Research Questions**
>Does being male or female in location X increase or decrease the liklihood of developing a certain type of cancer?
>
>Can previous patterns of cancer incidence predict future incidence of cancer in different geographic regions? How far into the future are these predictions valid?
>
>What can the distributions or trends of cancer incidence in different regions tell us about environmental factors that have influence over that population?
>
>How can differences that influence the entire regional population be identified? Do they consume food from different sources? Are they closer or farther from the ocean or is there a difference between the populations around different oceans?
